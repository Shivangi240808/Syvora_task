#Test1
A Python application created to track and evaluate individual debts and credits is included in this repository. Users of the program can keep track of transactions, check the status of outstanding bills, and find out who is most in debt or who owes the most money.
It is efficient to add transactions and run queries because the program maintains track of every transaction in a dictionary structure. Simple instructions can be used by users to interact with the application and carry out a variety of tasks linked to credits and debts.
