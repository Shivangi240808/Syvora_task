# Transactions between individuals

## Filename: transactions.py
A Python application created to track and evaluate individual debts and credits is included in this repository. Users of the program can keep track of transactions, check the status of outstanding bills, and find out who is most in debt or who owes the most money.
It is efficient to add transactions and run queries because the program maintains track of every transaction in a dictionary structure. Simple instructions can be used by users to interact with the application and carry out a variety of tasks linked to credits and debts.

# Maximum average subarray

## Filename: max_avgerage.py
The problem of determining the contiguous subarray with the maximum average value, when the subarray length is larger than or equal to a certain integer k, has a Python solution available in this repository.
A sliding window approach in conjunction with a binary search is used to implement the solution. This method effectively reduces the range of potential average values to get the maximum average.
